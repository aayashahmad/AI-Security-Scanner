   - Configure X-Frame-Options or frame-ancestors in CSP

2. **HTTPS Implementation**: Ensure all pages are served over HTTPS.
   - Obtain an SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt offers free certificates)
   - Configure your web server to redirect HTTP to HTTPS
   - Update all internal links to use HTTPS

3. **Cookie Security**: Review and update all cookies with proper security flags.
   - Add Secure flag to ensure cookies are only sent over HTTPS
   - Add HttpOnly flag to prevent JavaScript access to sensitive cookies
   - Set SameSite attribute to Lax or Strict to prevent CSRF attacks
