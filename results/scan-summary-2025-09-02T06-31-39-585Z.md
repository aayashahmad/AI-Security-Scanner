### Top Recommendations

1. Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent XSS attacks by specifying which dynamic resources are allowed to load.
2. Prevent clickjacking attacks by implementing X-Frame-Options or frame-ancestors in your Content Security Policy.
3. Regularly update all software components and dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
4. Implement a web application firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks.
5. Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.

### Remediation Steps

1. **Security Headers**: Implement all missing security headers in your web server configuration or application code.
   - Add Content-Security-Policy to restrict resource loading
   - Enable Strict-Transport-Security with a long max-age
   - Set X-Content-Type-Options to nosniff
   - Configure X-Frame-Options or frame-ancestors in CSP

2. **HTTPS Implementation**: Ensure all pages are served over HTTPS.
   - Obtain an SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt offers free certificates)
   - Configure your web server to redirect HTTP to HTTPS
   - Update all internal links to use HTTPS

3. **Cookie Security**: Review and update all cookies with proper security flags.
   - Add Secure flag to ensure cookies are only sent over HTTPS
   - Add HttpOnly flag to prevent JavaScript access to sensitive cookies
   - Set SameSite attribute to Lax or Strict to prevent CSRF attacks
